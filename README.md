Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address? 

 

Artemis Financial, a consulting company that specializes in personalized financial planning, hired Global Rain to modernize operations and enhance the security of their web-based software application. Their mission was to provide tailored financial plans covering savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their clients. The security concerns that Global Rain was tasked with implementing would increase the security measures to decrease the risk to client information and the company's infrastructure. 

Recognizing the challenges in a digital landscape, Artemis Financial prioritized both innovation and security. These challenges are fixed by first understanding the risks and goals of the company to safeguard their client's information.  The client aimed to upgrade and fortify their software against potential vulnerabilities. Artemis Financials has a responsibility to maintain customer trust, ensure regulations are in place to protect customer information and secure sensitive financial data. 

 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being? 

 

The first thing I did well once I found my client's vulnerabilities was to ensure all the information about the vulnerability was recorded to find out if the vulnerabilities were able to be fixed and to ensure they were hidden after the algorithm was run. Code must be secure, as it ensures the program can run securely, that code is secure and kept under the priority of the owners of the code, and that the code is secure from outside attacks. A company that has secure code and code that runs well and where the intentions of the programs are implemented, and the company has code that is private to their operations and safeguards the company and the clients. Outside forces will not be able to steal code or information and safeguard the infrastructure of the organization. 

 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? 

 

The most challenging part of vulnerability was understanding how to fix code when I wasn't able to run it correctly. I was able to fix this after doing some research to fix the errors I was having. I was also having some challenges when it came to finding all the vulnerabilities and writing down all the different vulnerabilities. Taking my time and understanding each section of the assignment was vital to ensuring that I was able to provide good code and good analysis to the client and make sure all errors were taken care of and any challenges that I had were taken care of promptly.   

 

 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? 

 

I increased layers of security by implementing multifactor authentication, enhancing encryption protocols, and fortifying access controls. In one of the assignments, I was tasked with implementing a key password, which was used to increase layer security. In future assessments that I could see from other tasks and systems, I would employ a combination of automated tools like vulnerability scanners alongside manual penetration testing to ensure a good examination of all vulnerabilities and other factors that can affect the likelihood of a security breach.  

I will also need to continue to monitor new techniques that can come in handy, and I will need to stay informed about emerging threats to guide the selection of appropriate mitigation techniques. Security audits will be completed to ensure that the system is secured. 

 

 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? 

 

To ensure that the code was running correctly I would double-check the code and then double-check if the program platform was correct so that the code was able to run. After running the code to check if I introduced new vulnerabilities I would check first if I had any errors that popped up from the new code and then rerun a vulnerability check to see if new ones arose after the code was run. After all these steps were taken, I was able to run down the list of vulnerabilities and then see if they could be fixed or if they needed to be hidden for the next programmer.   

 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? 

 

I used many resources from each week to sure I was able to understand what I needed to do to complete my assignments each week. I would also learn more about the command prompt from YouTube and how Java is used in vulnerability checks. In the future I think I will learn more from forums, GitHub, and programming books to get more detailed examples and techniques.   

 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment? 

 

This assignment showed and taught me proficiency in conducting a thorough vulnerability assessment for a client. I learned how security measures work to safeguard company data and client data.  I learned how to write vulnerability assessment reports and how to write secure code. I was also tasked to write up a comprehensive mitigation plan, which will help me in the future. My writing skills and critical thinking skills were showcased in the class and will be a useful tool in my journey going forward and to add value to future employees.
